  !select :uniq($my:nick) from #hive where $sys:version <> 0.2

  !select $ruby:eval[1 + 2] from #hive
  !select {1 + 2} from #hive

  !select :sum($sys:echo[1]) from #run_tests

  !select [:product($sys:version) + :product($sys:echo[2])] from #run_tests
  !select $ruby:eval[$sys:version * 2]  from #hive

  !select $me:tag[me] from #hive where $my:session[os] ! /sparc/
  !select :sum($sys:version) from #hive group by $me:tag
  !select {$me:session[os][-3..-1]}, {2+4} :sum($sys:version) from #hive group by {$sys:session[os][-3..-1]}

The braces provide a way to escape into executable expressions from the do string.

the :sum, :product etc are collectors that collect data from multiple machines.
