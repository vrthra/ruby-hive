Hive-case4

You want each machine to be synchronized to the NTP server in hivehome, and want this to happen each day.

Doing the synchronization using rdate through hive.

    	|cat sync.seq
[:channel => '#hive'
!do $sys:rdate[hivehome]
]

setting up a cron for every day to do rdate.

    	|cat sync.seq
[:channel => '#hive'
!do $sys:rdate[hivehome] when $cron:syncdate[0 0 0]
]

The above will synchronize the machines every day 0 th second 0th minute of 0th hour.

Setting up a trigger to fire when a new machine is added to the hive so that you dont have to run sync.seq again.
Append below code to in hivehome:/public/hive/triggers.rb or use a separate file and require it in triggers.rb
trigger :synctrig do |channel, machine, action, args|
    case action
    when /join/
        say '!do $sys:rdate[hivehome] when $cron:syncdate[0 0 0]', machine
    when /part/
        #do nothing.
    end
end

and set it in #hive
!create trigger synct on #hive for join use synctrig

Wrapping it up.

   1. Setup the cron job on the machines currently in hive,
          	|cat sync.seq
      [:channel => '#hive'
      !do $sys:rdate[hivehome] when $cron:syncdate[0 0 0]
      ]

   2. Setup triggers for clients joining in future.
      in #hive: (notice the use of inline triggers compared to the previous use of persistent trigger in triggers.rb)
      !create trigger synct on #hive for join use {tell @machine,"!do $sys:rdate[hivehome] when $cron:syncdate[0 0 0]"}

      You can also use this instead.
      !create trigger synct for join use !do $sys:rdate[hivehome] when $cron:syncdate[0 0 0]
