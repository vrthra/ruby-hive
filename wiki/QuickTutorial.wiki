QuickTutorial

What you need.

Machines
* One Machine to act as the HiveHome
* Other Machines that will be HiveClients.

Assuming the machine acting as HiveHome is named as hivehome..

Required Tools
* Ruby 1.8.4 or above installed on all the machines
* Svn Installed in HiveHome
* A webserver setup in HiveHome
* Wget Installed on all HiveClients.
* An IRC Client to monitor the hive

HiveHome Installation
* Svn checkout
  Checkout the svn of hive to a directory /public/ in the hivehome
    	|svn checkout svn://code.google.com/p/ruby-hive

  This will create a directory called /public/hive.

* WebServer
Configure the webserver to serve /public/hive as http://hivehome/hive
start the webserver.

* Configure HiveHome
edit the /public/hive/config.rb and change the $config['home'] to the hivehome machine name.
$config['home'] = 'hivehome.com'
* Startup HiveHome
-v is verbose.
    	|ruby hivehome.rb -v

HiveClients Installation
Login to each hiveclients and repeat this.
    	|mkdir /hive
    	|cd /hive
    	|wget http://hivehome/hive/hiveclient.rb
    	|cat > .hiverc
$base = 'http://hivehome/hive/'
^D

    	| ruby hiveclient.rb -v

This will start the hivelcients and they will log into the hivehome irc server.

Monitoring.
Start your IRCClient and log on to hivehome.com
Join the channel #hive in that server. You should see a list all hiveclients in that channel with the names prefixed
with '_'

Verify every thing works
in the #hive channel, type the below command
   !do $my:name $my:os $sys:pwd

This should output the name os and the starting directory of all the hiveclients.
