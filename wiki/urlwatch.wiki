urlwatch accepts the name of watch to be done in this syntax.
{{{
   !do hello $me:session[url] when $urlwatch:newwatch[create:http://hivenet/path/]
   !do hello $me:session[url] when $urlwatch:newwatch[create:http://hivenet/path/file]
}}}

Here the syntax of [...] is 'action' ':' 'path'
if the path ends in '/' it is considered as a directory and the directory will be checked for any new files.
if it does not, it is considered as a file and it will be monitored for removal or creation(if it is not already available)

when these happen, the following fields will be set.
{{{
session[url]
}}}
