[[Hive-case2]]

A notification needs to be sent to 2 channels #solaris, #windows when a mail arrives in
our name in the watching machine (let us call it _watchmachine).
The members in each of these channels will have to mail to testresults@hivehome.com on completion of the tests.

|h2: Setting up the mailwatcher.

[term:
cat mailwatcher.seq
[out:
 [channel => '#hive'
 !do $me:tell[#solaris,#windows:initprocs] where $my:name =~/watchmachine/ when $mailwatch:mails[new:.*]
 ]
]
]

|h2: Setting up the testmachines,

[term:
cat tests.seq
[out:
 ['#solaris','#windows'].each do |c|
 [channel => c
 !do $me:map[result:$pat:start[-s mytests.seq]] $mail:send[testresults@hivehome.com:$me:map[result]]
 ]
 end
]
]

note the usage of map variable here. (It can be done another way with out the map variable as I will show in wrap up)


|h2: Wrapping it all up.
[term:
cat case2.seq
[out:
 [channel => '#hive'
 !do $me:tell[#solaris,#windows:initprocs] where $my:name =~~ /watchmachine/ when $mailwatch:mails[new:.*]
 ]
 ['#solaris','#windows'].each do |c|
 [channel => c
 !do $mail:send[testresults@hivehome.com:$pat:start[-s mytests.seq]]
 ]
 end
]
]

Here, the pat:start will get executed before the mailsend as it is with in the args of mail.

now go to #hive channel and do this.
[code:
   !do $me:seq[case2]
]
