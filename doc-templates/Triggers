|h1:Creating Triggers
|h2:Inline Triggers

Inline triggers are simple to create. They come in two major forms: 
[ol:
|li:A single command send to the machine that invokes the trigger
  !create trigger mytr for join use !do $sys:rdate[hivehome] 
	

Here, the command !do $sys:rdate[hivehome] is sent to the machine that joins the current channel. 

|li:A ruby block getting invoked in response to a triggered event
  !create trigger mytr for join use {|machine,args|tell(machine,'welcome') if machine !~/^_/} 
	
Here, the ruby block gets executed with args machine,args. 
]

|h2:Persistant Triggers

Persistant triggers are those that are included directly in triggers.rb. An example below 
[code:
trigger :mytrig do |channel, machine, action, args|
    case action 
    when /join/ 
        say '!do $system:version', machine do |reply|
            reply "got reply #{reply}" 
            reply "channel:#{channel} machine:#{machine} action:#{action} args:#{args}" 
        end
     when /part/ 
        reply "#{machine} leaving #{channel}" 
        reply "channel:#{channel} machine:#{machine} action:#{action} args:#{args}" 
    end 
    end 
end 
]

This is made use of below. 
[code:
  !create trigger mytr for join use mytrig 
]

These triggers are also allowed to take an argument which will be available in @initargs inside the MyTrigger. 
[code:
trigger :myargtrig do |channel, machine, action, args|
    @me.reply "Created with args #{@initargs}" 
end 
]

[code:
  !create trigger mytr for join use myargtrig(Created with this arg) 
]


|h1:Using Triggers

|h2:Creating
General example: 
[code:
  !create trigger dummyt on #hive for join use dummytrig 
]

Do it on default channel (no channel specified) 
[code:
  !create trigger dummyt for join use dummytrig 
]

Do it with args 
[code:
  !create trigger dummyt for join use dummytrig(myargs) 
]

Use Inline 
[code:
  !create trigger mytr for join use !do $sys:rdate[hivehome] 
]

Use Inline second version 
[code:
  !create trigger newtrig on #hive for part use {|machine,args| @me.send_message machine, '!do $sys:rdate[webproxy]'} 
]

|h2:Dropping
General: 
[code:
  !drop trigger dummytrig on #hive 
]

On current channel. 
[code:
  !drop trigger dummytrig 
]

|h2:Listing
List all triggers on channel 
[code:
  !triggers on #hive 
]

Assume channel 
[code:
  !triggers 
]

Triggers for action 'join' 
[code:
  !triggers on #hive for join 
]

Triggers that use a particular procedure 
[code:
  !triggers on #hive using dummytrig 
]

Triggers that use a particular procedure and for a particular action 
[code:
  !triggers on #hive for join using dummytrig
