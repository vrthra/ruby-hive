|h2: What you need.

|h3: Machines
* One Machine to act as the HiveHome
* Other Machines that will be HiveClients.

Assuming the machine acting as HiveHome is named as hivehome..

|h3: Required Tools
* Ruby 1.8.4 or above installed on all the machines
* Svn Installed in HiveHome
* A webserver setup in HiveHome
* Wget Installed on all HiveClients.
* An IRC Client to monitor the hive

|h2: HiveHome Installation
* Svn checkout
  Checkout the svn of hive to a directory /public/ in the hivehome
|term:svn checkout svn://webproxy.india.sun.com/svn/hive

  This will create a directory called /public/hive.

* WebServer
Configure the webserver to serve /public/hive as http://hivehome/hive
start the webserver.

* Configure HiveHome
edit the /public/hive/config.rb and change the $config['home'] to the hivehome machine name.
[code:
$config['home'] = 'hivehome.com'
]
* Startup HiveHome
 -v is verbose.
|term:ruby hivehome.rb -v

|h2: HiveClients Installation
Login to each hiveclients and repeat this.
|term:mkdir /hive
|term:cd /hive
|term:wget http://hivehome/hive/hiveclient.rb
[term:
cat > .hiverc
[out:
 $base = 'http://hivehome/hive/'
 ^D
]
]

|term: ruby hiveclient.rb -v

This will start the hivelcients and they will log into the hivehome irc server.

|h2: Monitoring.
Start your IRCClient and log on to hivehome.com
Join the channel #hive in that server. You should see a list all hiveclients in that channel with the names prefixed
with '_'

|h2: Verify every thing works
in the #hive channel, type the below command
[code:
   !do $my:name $my:os $sys:pwd
]

This should output the name os and the starting directory of all the hiveclients.
